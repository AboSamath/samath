## Introduction

The Polars library is a data processing library for Python, which allows to manipulate tabular data in an efficient and fast way. 
This library provides similar functionality to Pandas, but with much higher performance, using Rust as the underlying language.

## Concept presentation

The Polars library is particularly useful for processing large data, as it uses task parallelization to speed up data transformation operations.
In the picture below we have a comparison regarding the performance with the other library.
